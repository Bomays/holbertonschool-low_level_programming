#Functions_nested_loops project README

**START and TASK 0** 
Learning how to create our own .h library file for preprocessing
and how to create our first prototype function "_putchar"

**TASK 1**
 Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line:
        Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);                                            You can only use _putchar twice in your code
